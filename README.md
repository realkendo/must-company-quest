1. While developing the linux crawler for quest 4, i had an error stating 'cannot read properties undefined' while trying to run my crawler, which i later realized was caused by my cheerio library, i got to find out that i could not use the regular ESmodule import as i have set in my tsconfig.json file to use 'CommonJs' because cheerio does not have a defualt export in CommonJs mode, so i have to change the import style to use namewspace import instead of the default
